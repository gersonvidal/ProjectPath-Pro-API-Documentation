# Introduction 

Welcome to the Getting Started guide for the ProjectPath-Pro API! This documentation assumes you are using a system running Windows 10 or a later version. While the instructions are tailored for Windows users, similar steps can be followed on other operating systems with minor adjustments.

## Why Windows? 

For simplicity, this guide focuses on Windows 10 or newer because the developer of the API used Windows 11 and would lose too much time setting it up on Linux just for the documentation. hehe hehe

## Key Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure your system meets these requirements:

1. **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher.
2. **64-bit Architecture:** Ensure your Windows installation supports 64-bit applications, as Docker Desktop requires it.
